#  Final Project

by Zhuo Leng and Weijia Li



This page is for the final project of the course Data Visualisation. We conducted a research on users behaviour of application Spotify. The graphs can be found at: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TXNF2KsageqQ8z4u-xo6v0CVb0ziQ5X0


The visualisations can be reproduced by downloading all files on this page and run the `app.R` file in R.
