#  Final Project

by Zhuo Leng and Weijia Li



This page is for the final project of the course Data Visualisation. We conducted a research on users behaviour of application Spotify. All files, include data and app.R, can be found at: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TXNF2KsageqQ8z4u-xo6v0CVb0ziQ5X0. Please download the zip file in the google drive to reproduce the graphs.


The visualisations can be reproduced by downloading all files on this page and run the `app.R` file in R.
